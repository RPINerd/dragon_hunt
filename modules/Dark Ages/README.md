# Dark Ages

An overhaul to the worldmap, dungeons, and towns for improved graphics and fresh architecture

## Gameplay Changes

- There is no longer a hit% stat; instead, the % is built into your attack rating
- The blind spell now reduces attack/defense directly
- Chances for battle/run % are different
- Costs for armor/weapons are higher, as you can resell them at full price
- You must manually equip weapons/armor
- There are a few secrets hidden around! Pay close attention to the environment..
